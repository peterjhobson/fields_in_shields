fields_in_shields.py

Optimizes current flow on the surface of a current-carrying cylinder inside a closed magnetically shielded cylinder to generate any physical target magnetic field. Use generatewires_cylindrical.py to design cylindrical coil systems and generatewires_biplanar.py to design bi-planar coil systems. The 'modules' folder contains the component modules and 'examples_cylindrical'/'examples_biplanar' contain simple designs. Have fun :D
