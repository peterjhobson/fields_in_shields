Optimizes current flow on the surface of a current-carrying cylinder inside a closed magnetically shielded cylinder to generate any physical target magnetic field following the method in https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02981. Use generatewires.py to design systems. The 'modules' folder contains the component modules and 'examples' contains simple designs. Have fun :D
